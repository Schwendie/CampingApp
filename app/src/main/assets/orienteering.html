		<h1>Orienteering</h1>
		<p>Orienteering is a sport, but the basics of this sport have practical uses for navigating the wilderness.</p>
		
		<h2>Practical Basics</h2>
		
		<h3>Without Compass</h3>
		
		<h4>General</h4>
		<p>The sun will rise in the East and set in the West.  In the Northern Hemisphere, the sun is due South at local noon.  In the Southern Hemisphere, the sun is due North at local noon.</p>
		<p>The position of the sun will give a rough approximation of what direction you are heading in.</p>
		
		<h4>Watch Method</h4>
		<p>An analog watch can be used to gain one’s bearing.  The following method will help you find the North line.</p>
		<p>Hold the watch horizontally with the hour hand pointing at the sun.  Bisect the angle between the hour hand and 12 to give the South line.</p>
		
		<h4>Stick Method - Quick Version</h4>
		<p>This method takes 15-20 minutes</p>
		<p>Stick a pole or straight stick in the ground and mark where the tip of its shadow falls.</p>
		<p>Wait for at least 15 minutes, and then mark the new location of the shadow.</p>
		<p>Joining these two marked points will give the East-West line.  The North-South line is perpendicular to this line.</p>
		<p><i>Note</i>: First mark is Westerly.</p>
		
		<h4>Stick Method - Long Version</h4>
		<p>More accurate than quick version</p>
		<p>Stick pole or stick upright in ground and mark where the tip of the shadow falls in the morning.</p>
		<p>Attach string or similar object to base of pole or stick, and trace out an arc with the pole at the center.</p>
		<p>When the shadow cast from the pole again reaches the arc in the afternoon, mark that spot.</p>
		<p>Draw a line from the mark made in the morning to the mark made in the afternoon.  This is your East-West line.  The North-South line is perpendicular.</p>
		<p><i>Note</i>: First mark is Westerly.</p>
		
		<h3>Night</h3>
		
		<h4>General</h4>
		<p>The Stars and moon rise in the east and set in the west.</p>
		
		<h4>Pole Star</h4>
		<p>In the Northern Hemisphere, Polaris, the star at the North Celestial Pole, can be used for getting a bearing at night.  Polaris is NOT the brightest star in the night sky.  Instead, it can be found using one of several obvious constellations and asterisms.</p>
		<p>The constellation Cassiopeia, and the two asterisms The Big Dipper and Orion’s Belt can be used to identify the pole star.</p>

		<h4>Star Movement</h4>
		<p>A rough direction can be gleaned from the movements of stars.  In the Northern Hemisphere, if a certain star seems to fall over time, you are facing West.  If the star seems to curve flatly to the right, you are facing South.  If the star seems to curve flatly to the left, you are facing North.</p>
		<p><i>Note</i>: This system will work with any star other than the pole star.</p>
